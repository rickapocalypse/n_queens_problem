# Problem Description
The eight queens problem is the mathematical problem of arranging eight queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that none of them is attacked by another. For that, it is necessary that any two queens are not in the same row, column, or diagonal. This is a specific case of the n queens problem, in which we have n queens and a board with n × n squares (for any n ≥ 4). In this work, an interface is presented to run the Hill Climbing, Simulated Anneling, Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing and Stochastic Hill Climbing algorithms to solve the eight queens problem. In this interface it is possible to check the step-by-step of each state chosen by the algorithm until finding the final solution of the problem.
